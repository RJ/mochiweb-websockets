MochiWeb is an Erlang library for building lightweight HTTP servers.

--

I've added websockets support to mochiweb such that you can use the same port
for ws: as you can for normal web requests.

Consult examples/websocket/src/websocket_web.erl to see how you define a loop
specifically for handling websocket connections.

This is based on from http://github.com/davebryson/erlang_websocket 
The main difference is that my version uses one port and avoids running a 
distinct service for ws: - it upgrades normal mochiweb connections.
